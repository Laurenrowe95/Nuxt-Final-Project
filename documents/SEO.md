SEO.md
Search Engine Optimization has many interesting components to it from what I learned. “H” tags and their hierarchy are very important when you are creating content. 
More than 1 H1 tag will hurt your score because it confuses the crawler. It is also important to use only high-quality websites when linking to ensure that your score remains high. Adding ghost text or extra “fluff” to your website is frowned upon because they will be detected and hurt your score. You can also add Google Analytics by adding code to your site and heat maps are useful for telling you were users hover and also where might be the best spot to put specific popularly searched information on your website.
	Through further research I also learned that creating an author page for your website can be useful. I know that for news sites this is helpful, but I could also see using a similar concept for my site as well where a profile, projects worked on, and other useful links could be displayed and then used for SEO purposes. I also learned more about deep linking and how to use that to link to a specific part of a webpage instead of the entire page. This helps the search be more useful and concise for the viewer/user. Reputation research was also recommended as reviews online can positively or negatively impact your SEO and it is useful to be aware of what others have said or written about your business. Favicon images can also be helpful in making your site standout and are recommended as well, especially with the new GA4 version.

	


SEO Implementation Plan:
1. First I would do a keyword search to see what might be the best fit for the audience or customers I am trying to connect with. Keywords that I found through Google suggest included plant specific photography as well as Seattle based plant services. This suggests to me that including information about the location of my business may be helpful on my About page.
2. Next I would do some research on what similar pages or companies come up first on the search list. For mine, Etsy, Pinterest, and American Scientist were the top search results. This means that if I could link to Etsy or Pinterest, that may be helpful in my SEO results for my own page.
3. For visual search optimization, I could increase my chances by making sure all my portfolio images have a high enough amount of contrast for image trackers to interpret it correctly as well as making sure the flowers have a clear outline and description tag. 
4. I could also create a resources page which would include some links to reputable plant care websites as well as niche photography sites.
5. I can also improve my content layout and design to make it more clear, precise, and colorful for the reader.
6. Lastly, I would make sure to add buttons to make it easier to add my content on social media platforms  as well as include some meta tags.

For maintenance later on, I will update my portfolio regularly, check my reviews online to see what customers have to say about the, and also make sure that if I decide to open a physical store location, that Google My Business categories are correct for my business in Google Maps. This will ensure that customers can find me both online and in person more easily.
